# Taboo

An old demo I did for an interview.

Basic rules of the traditional board game apply. Click the "Rules" link for details.

# Quick Start

Remember to `npm install` dependencies. Then run:

```
node server.js
```

# TODO

- Clean up code, fix some bugs. Most of it was rushed.
- Moar Cards!
- Persist a score board after users quit
