An old demo I did for an interview. 

Basic rules of the traditional board game apply.

Quick Start
===========

Remember to `npm install` dependencies. THen run:

```
node server.js

Migrate to newer library versions

* Socket.IO 0.7->1.0

Clean up code, fix some bugs. Most of it was rushed.
Moar Cards!
